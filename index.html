    <h1>LION</h1>
    <section>
            <article>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family 
            Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It has a 
            muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, 
            round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
            It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a 
            prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length 
            of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females 
            at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). It is a social species, 
            forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of 
            a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of 
            female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on 
            large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; 
            although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and 
            have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.

            One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in 
            human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted 
            in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in 
            contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in 
            menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been 
            a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens 
            across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural 
            depictions of lions were prominent in the Upper Paleolithic 
            period; carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet 
            Caves in France have been dated to 17,000 years ago, and 
            depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval 
            cultures that coincided with the lion's former and current ranges.
